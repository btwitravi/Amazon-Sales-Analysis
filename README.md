# Amazon-Sales-Analysis

This project presents a complete end-to-end analysis of Amazon’s annual sales to uncover customer behaviour, product performance, payment trends, and delivery efficiency.
Python is used for data cleaning, preparation, and exploratory analysis, while Power BI is used to design interactive dashboards for business storytelling.

## 🔍 Business Problem
E-commerce platforms experience high customer demand during major sales seasons.
However, understanding which product categories and items drive the highest revenue,
and how customer feedback and purchasing behaviour influence sales, remains crucial for
optimizing business strategy.

This project evaluates Amazon’s overall sales performance, identifies top-performing
categories & products, analyses customer sentiment, and uncovers key revenue patterns.
