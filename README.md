# Amazon-Sales-Analysis

An end-to-end data analysis project using Python and Power BI to understand Amazon’s sales performance, customer behaviour, and feedback patterns.

## 🔍 Business Problem
E-commerce platforms experience high customer demand during major sales seasons.
However, understanding which product categories and items drive the highest revenue,
and how customer feedback and purchasing behaviour influence sales, remains crucial for
optimizing business strategy.

This project evaluates Amazon’s overall sales performance, identifies top-performing
categories & products, analyses customer sentiment, and uncovers key revenue patterns.
